make a proper config file + include a good index.html and index.htm example


Make a html page displaying all cat in the img/cats directory. It gets it by getting directory listing, displaying cats wiht a delete button - > DELETE request, also an upload button -> post request



FOR SARAH HELLO:

If i run these two curls i end up witha  "Reading from client connection failed
" message, which isnt super bad but a little bit bad since its not supposed to be that way
i think i might have made an oversight in like Client cleanup or epoll cleanup but not super
Either way most shit works yay

curl -X POST http://localhost:2345 \
  -F "file1=@testfiles/text1.txt" \
  -F "file2=@testfiles/text2.txt"


curl -X DELETE http://localhost:2345/uploads/text2.txt
