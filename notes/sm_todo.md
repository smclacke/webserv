- how does julius want to add dirs to srcs?

- how does julius want to work with header(s)

- do we need to work out/worry about how erroring hanging now? maybe good idea before doing too much writing

- STRUCTS + CLASSES :)

- what poll() and why and how and poll loop



 - header include libraries: 
// later make decisions about what we actually use and remove unnecessary
